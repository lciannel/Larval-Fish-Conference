# Larval-Fish-Conference
Here you will find R scripts and data files to reproduce some of the analyses shown at the Larval Fish Conference keynote lecture (also contained in this repository). The name of the file should be rather self-explanatory as to what the files does or is needed for. You are free to use, at your own risk, any of the data and Rscript files contained in this repository. If you have suggestions for how to improve the scripts, please contact me. I suggest that for running these analyses you download all the files and script in the same directory. The script will call the data files contained in that directory.

The GAM Manual is a set of notes put together for GAM courses that I taught at my home institution (OSU). There you will find examples of Variable Coefficients Models, analyses with Zero Inflated Data, both of which are shown in the presentation. There are other things in the GAM Manual.

Examples of Habitat Constraint Analyses are shown for Alaska Plaice and Arrowtooth Flounder in the Bering Sea. Data and scripts for each are provided.
